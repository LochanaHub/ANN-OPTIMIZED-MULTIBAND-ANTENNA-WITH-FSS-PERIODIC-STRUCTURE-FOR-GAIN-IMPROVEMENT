# ANN-OPTIMIZED-MULTIBAND-ANTENNA-WITH-FSS-PERIODIC-STRUCTURE-FOR-GAIN-IMPROVEMENT
In this project the antenna has been proposed for UMTS [2.1GHz] and WLAN applications [5GHz] which is developed on FR4 substrate having dielectric constant of 4.4. In this project, the antenna has been designed using three methods(i.e,HFSS, ANN, and FSS) for gain improvement.
